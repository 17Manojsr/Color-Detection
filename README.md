# Color-Detection

A Color Detection Python is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps.Also, this Python Color Detection Using OpenCV is the process of detecting the name of any color.

When talking about this Color Detection in Python, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

Before we start building this Color Detection Using Python, you should be familiar with the computer vision library of Python that is OpenCV and Pandas.

OpenCV, Pandas, and numpy are the Python packages that are necessary for this project in Python. To install them, simply run this pip command in your terminal:
